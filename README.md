Hello, I'm Shi Hong Huang, a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science with a solid background in mechatronics, programming, and software development. I have experience in web scraping, machine learning, and developing full-stack web applications. I am proficient in Python, PHP, JavaScript, Vue.js, C++, and databases such as MySQL and SQLSRV. Additionally, I have worked with Federated Learning and autonomous driving models for decentralized learning. I am skilled at deploying solutions on cloud platforms like GCP. Passionate about leveraging technology to create efficient, data-driven solutions, I have hands-on experience in projects involving betting arbitrage detection, event captioning for educational videos, and smart systems development. I am eager to apply my technical expertise in research and industry, while continuously learning and growing in fields such as artificial intelligence, management systems, and decentralized technologies.
